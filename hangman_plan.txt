Things to add:
1. reorganise: make functions file, config file 
2. make a login system 
    - asks for and store username and password
    - records each games' word and score 
3. Make an algorithm that gives a score (eg. ech level has a number * no of remaining tries?)
4. Host online (how would that work? user interface?)
